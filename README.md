# API Gateway

The API border router.

## To setup

```
> yarn install
```

## To develop just just run:

```
> yarn develop
```

This will start up the API processing watching for changes in addition to watchers
on spec files in the `src` and `e2e` folders; intelligently watching for changes
and reloading the respective component as required.
